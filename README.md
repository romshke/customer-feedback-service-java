This is the *Customer Feedback Service* project I made myself.


<p>There are many market places on the Internet and customers often rate goods they buy. This project offers you an opportunity to try yourself in building a web service for saving, storing and finding customer feedback data using Spring Boot and the popular MongoDB database.</p>
